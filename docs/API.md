# Airsonic-Pulse API Reference

Airsonic-Pulse exposes a music-streaming API that is compatible with the **Subsonic API** and implements a growing set of **OpenSubsonic** extensions. This document is generated from the codebase and reflects the actual state of the implemented endpoints.

- **Subsonic protocol version reported:** `1.16.1`
- **Server type:** `airsonic-pulse`
- **OpenSubsonic:** advertised (`openSubsonic=true`, `serverVersion` present)

## API surfaces

Airsonic-Pulse serves three overlapping API surfaces:

- **Subsonic** — the standard [Subsonic API](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp). Airsonic-Pulse implements the complete Subsonic 1.16.1 endpoint surface.
- **OpenSubsonic** — the [OpenSubsonic](https://opensubsonic.netlify.app/) extensions: a compliant response envelope, the `getOpenSubsonicExtensions` discovery endpoint, additional endpoints, and enrichment fields layered onto existing Subsonic response types.
- **Native** — Airsonic-Pulse specific endpoints that are not part of the Subsonic or OpenSubsonic specifications.

### Endpoints and paths

All Subsonic/OpenSubsonic endpoints are served under both `/rest/<endpoint>` and `/rest/<endpoint>.view`, and accept both `GET` and `POST` (`formPost` extension). Most endpoints are also mapped under `/ext/<endpoint>` for JWT-authenticated external/share access. Response format is selected with the `f` request parameter (`xml`, `json`, or `jsonp`).

### Authentication

Standard Subsonic authentication parameters apply to all `/rest/**` endpoints (`u` plus `p`, or `u` plus `t`+`s` token/salt). `getOpenSubsonicExtensions` is the only endpoint that does not require authentication. Removal of legacy authentication methods and an `apiKeyAuthentication` extension are planned — see [#56](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/56) and [#145](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/145).

### How the endpoints were organized

The Subsonic API began as a single `SubsonicRESTController` monolith and was split into 16 domain controllers under tracking issue [#34](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/34), with cross-cutting follow-ups for exception handling ([#98](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/98)), a shared base class ([#112](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/112)), and a hygiene sweep ([#176](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/176)). The endpoint reference below is a single table grouped by the **Domain** column. The **Ref** column lists the issue(s) that implemented or updated that specific endpoint — typically the controller-extraction issue that moved it, plus any endpoint-specific functional change.

## Status legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ | **Implemented** — fully working in the current codebase |
| 🔧 | **Partial** — exists but incomplete or with known limitations |
| 🚧 | **In Progress** — actively being worked on |
| 📋 | **Planned** — on the roadmap / tracked by an open issue |
| ❌ | **Not Planned** — no plans to implement |

**API Type:** `Subsonic` (standard spec) · `OpenSubsonic` (extension or new endpoint) · `Native` (Airsonic-Pulse specific) · `Legacy` (deprecated / slated for removal).

Airsonic-Pulse registers the complete Subsonic 1.16.1 endpoint surface — there are no entirely-absent Subsonic endpoints. The only functional caveats are `getVideoInfo` (🔧 routed but not implemented) and the chat endpoints (❌ intentionally unsupported).

## OpenSubsonic capabilities (non-endpoint)

The items in this section are part of OpenSubsonic compliance but are **not callable endpoints** — they are the response envelope, the capability flags advertised through `getOpenSubsonicExtensions`, and enrichment fields added to existing Subsonic responses. The OpenSubsonic-specific *endpoints* themselves (`getOpenSubsonicExtensions`, `getLyricsBySongId`, `getPodcastEpisode`, `getPlayQueueByIndex`, `savePlayQueueByIndex`) appear in the endpoint reference above with API Type `OpenSubsonic`. Tracking issue: [#35 — Implement OpenSubsonic API support](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/35).

### Base compliance — ✅ Implemented

- Response envelope advertises `openSubsonic=true`, `type="airsonic-pulse"`, and `serverVersion` ([#64](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/64)).
- Protocol version reported as `1.16.1` ([#113](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/113)).
- Extension discovery available via the `getOpenSubsonicExtensions` endpoint ([#66](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/66)).

### Declared extension flags — ✅ Implemented

These are returned by `getOpenSubsonicExtensions`:

| Extension | Version | Status | Ref | Notes |
|-----------|---------|--------|-----|-------|
| `formPost` | 1 | ✅ | [#66](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/66) | All endpoints accept `POST` |
| `transcodeOffset` | 1 | ✅ | [#132](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/132) | `stream` accepts a transcode time offset |
| `songLyrics` | 1 | ✅ | [#131](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/131), [#157](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/157), [#158](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/158) | `getLyricsBySongId`; unsynced lyrics read from tags at request time |
| `indexBasedQueue` | 1 | ✅ | [#141](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/141) | Adds `getPlayQueueByIndex` / `savePlayQueueByIndex` |

### Response field enrichments — ✅ Implemented

| Type | Fields | Ref |
|------|--------|-----|
| `Child` | `played`, `musicBrainzId`, `displayArtist`, `displayAlbumArtist`, `mediaType`, `sortName`, `bpm`, `genres[]`, `replayGain` | [#129](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/129), [#130](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/130), [#134](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/134), [#135](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/135), [#139](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/139), [#143](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/143) |
| `AlbumID3` | `played`, `playCount`, `musicBrainzId`, `displayArtist`, `sortName` | [#129](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/129), [#130](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/130), [#136](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/136) |
| `ArtistID3` | `musicBrainzId`, `sortName`, `mediaType` | [#130](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/130), [#137](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/137), [#138](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/138) |
| `Artist` (legacy, returned by `getIndexes` / `getStarred`) | `userRating`, `averageRating` | [#179](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/179) |

### Response field enrichments — 📋 Planned

| Item | Ref |
|------|-----|
| `contributors[]` — multi-role contributor extraction | [#144](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/144) |
| `AlbumID3` bundle — `isCompilation`, `releaseTypes`, `originalReleaseDate`, `discTitles`, `recordLabels` | [#142](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/142) |
| `songLyrics` — synced / LRC support with DB storage | [#140](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/140) |

### Capability extensions — 📋 Planned (not yet declared)

| Extension | Ref | Notes |
|-----------|-----|-------|
| `apiKeyAuthentication` | [#145](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/145) | Tied to removal of legacy authentication ([#56](https://github.com/Airsonic-Pulse/airsonic-pulse/issues/56)); would add the `tokenInfo` endpoint (see the endpoint reference) |

### Response fields — ❌ Not currently planned

These OpenSubsonic response fields exist in the specification but have no tracking issue yet:

- Audio-detail `Child` fields: `bitDepth`, `samplingRate`, `channelCount`.
- `Child.moods[]`, `explicitStatus`.
